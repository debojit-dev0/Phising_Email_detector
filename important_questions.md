1. **What is phishing?**

Phishing is a trick where attackers pretend to be someone trustworthy (like a bank or company) to steal your information—passwords, OTPs, credit card details, or personal data.


2. **How to identify a phishing email?**

Look for signs like:

Unknown or suspicious sender

Urgent messages (“Your account will close!”)

Links that look strange or mismatched

Spelling mistakes or odd language

Attachments you didn’t expect

Email address that doesn’t match the real company


3. **What is email spoofing?**

Email spoofing means the attacker fakes the “From” address to make it look like the email came from a trusted person or organization.


4. **Why are phishing emails dangerous?**

Because they can:

Steal your passwords

Install malware

Take over your accounts

Steal money

Trick you into sharing sensitive information

A single click can cause serious damage.


5. **How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?**

Check the real email address, not just the name

Hover over links to see the actual URL

Look at domain spelling (example: paypa1.com)

Contact the person/company directly using official contact info

Check email headers to see the real source

Verify if the website uses HTTPS and correct domain


6. **What tools can analyze email headers?**

Google’s Message Header Analyzer

MxToolbox Header Analyzer

Microsoft Message Header Tool

Header Checkers built into email security tools (like Proofpoint, Mimecast)

These tools show where the email actually came from.


7. **What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?**

Don’t click any links

Don’t download attachments

Don’t reply

Report it to your IT/security team

Mark it as spam/phishing

Delete the email

If you clicked accidentally, change passwords immediately.


8. **How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?**

They manipulate emotions to make you act fast.
Common tricks include:

Fear (“Your account is locked”)

Curiosity (“Payment receipt attached”)

Urgency (“Update now or lose access”)

Trust (“Message from your boss or bank”)

They use human psychology, not just technology.
