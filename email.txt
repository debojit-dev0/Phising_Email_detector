Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Prince Abdul Rahman, son of the late King of Nigeria. Before his untimely death in a plane crash, my father deposited $25,000,000 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars) with a security company in Europe. Due to political unrest, I cannot access these funds directly.

I need your urgent assistance to transfer this money to your account. In return, I will give you 40% of the total sum ($10,000,000) for your help. This is risk-free and confidential. Please reply immediately with your full name, phone number, and bank details to proceed.

Time is of the essence—act now before the funds are seized!

Best regards,
Prince Abdul Rahman
